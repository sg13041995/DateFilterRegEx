dPer Pt Intake from 7/1973: Sometimes has passive "fleeting" thoughts about death ("It would be so much easier to be dead.")  More commonly will think about disappearing and starting over somewhere geographically different.  Does not see suicide or relocating as an option.  Has never taken any action towards acting on either of these thoughts.  These thoughts are followed by the thought "that's not realistic Lowery."  This "resets" the patient and allows her to focus back on the task or challenge at hand.Hx of Non Suicidal Self Injurious Behavior: No

She shared that she has recently lost a great deal of weight and is having difficulty meeting her calorie needs due to difficulties with gagging/swallowing, and aversions to specific food textures.  Specifically, since May 2012, she has lost 18 lbs, going from 128 lbs (BMI = 19.5, normal range) to 110.2 lbs (BMI = 16.8, underweight range) at a height of 5'8" tall.  She has had amenorrhea for 2 months.  Her current weight is her lowest since high school, when she was a model and weighed 98 lbs (BMI = 14.9, underweight range).  At that time, she had amenorrhea, felt pressure to be thin in order to keep her job, and most likely met criteria for frank anorexia nervosa nervosa-restricting type.
